## Under The Hood

- This project utilizes Amazon's S3 cloud storage for both images and archive files related to the mods
- The app relies heavily on Flask and Jinja in order to be dynamic and anticipate future features to be implemented
- When a file or image is uploaded a random number is generated and the name of the files/images are replaced in order to prevent mods or images with the same name from being overwritten
